# 1. Digital Contracts

Contracts should be digitised so that anyone on any side of any contract can see what they are responsible for and any actions they can take within the contract. There should be a UI for interacting with the contract. If I have a contract with a company to do with my private data, I should be able to request data through the UI. Or if If I have a phone contract and I am eligible for an upgrade, I should be able to upgrade.
