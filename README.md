# One Thousand Ideas for Computing

# 1. Digital Contracts

Contracts should be digitised so that anyone on any side of any contract can see what they are responsible for and any actions they can take within the contract. There should be a UI for interacting with the contract. If I have a contract with a company to do with my private data, I should be able to request data through the UI. Or if If I have a phone contract and I am eligible for an upgrade, I should be able to upgrade through the UI.

# 2. Mobile legal business creation and Personal ERP

Someone with a phone should be able to just create a business that satisfies all reporting requirements and is a legal entity. I want to see a mobile phone app that implements enterprise resource planning for the gig economy.

# 3. Telework

Computational problems can be rendered into labelled graphical video streams upon which people vote. People can solve computational problems with a television monitor, numbered graphs and a keypad that they enter sequences of numbers into. Problems like efficient scheduling of cars for carpooling or deliveries are solvable by human beings quickly with a user interface that allows one to lasso points on the map and add cars. This is for problems that are not strictly numerical.

# 4. Paper Work Language

We need a way to define work. All work can be represented digitally. This standard is that a piece of work must fit on an A4 piece of paper. A bit like a job description but each page represents a task. So you have a piece of A4 paper describing one piece of work to do. Each piece of work can depend on other pieces of work. Can be integrated into a continuous integration pipeline for human beings. Work appears in your work inbox.
